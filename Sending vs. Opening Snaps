Question:
Assume you are given the tables below containing information on Snapchat users, their ages, and their time spent sending and opening snaps. 
Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps (as a percentage of total time spent on these activities) for each age group.

Output the age bucket and percentage of sending and opening snaps. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

You should calculate these percentages:
time sending / (time sending + time opening)
time opening / (time sending + time opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

activities Table:
Column Name	Type
activity_id	integer
user_id	integer
activity_type	string ('send', 'open', 'chat')
time_spent	float
activity_date	datetime

age_breakdown Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
age_bucket	string ('21-25', '26-30', '31-25')

Query:
with temp_cte AS
(SELECT activities.user_id, activities.activity_type, activities.time_spent,
       ab.age_bucket,
case when activities.activity_type = 'send' then time_spent else 0 end as time_send,
case when activities.activity_type = 'open' then time_spent else 0 end as time_open
from activities 
inner join age_breakdown as ab
on activities.user_id = ab.user_id
where (activities.activity_type = 'send' OR
activities.activity_type ='open'))
Select age_bucket,
round(sum(time_send)*100.0/sum(time_spent),2)  as send_perc,
round(sum(time_open)*100.0/sum(time_spent),2) as open_perc
from temp_cte
GROUP BY age_bucket
