Question:

Assume you are given the table below containing the information on the searches attempted and the percentage of invalid searches by country. Write a query to obtain the percentage of invalid searches.

Output the country in ascending order, total searches and overall percentage of invalid searches rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

num_search = Number of searches attempted; invalid_result_pct = Percentage of invalid searches.
In cases where countries have search attempts but do not have a percentage of invalid searches in invalid_result_pct, it should be excluded, and vice versa.
To find the percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100 to avoid integer division.
search_category Table:
Column Name	Type
country	string
search_cat	string
num_search	integer
invalid_result_pct	decimal


Query:

with temp_cte AS(
SELECT country, 
num_search,
round((invalid_result_pct * num_search)/100.0,2) as invalid_results
from search_category
where (invalid_result_pct  >0 and num_search >0) 
)
Select country,
sum(num_search) as total_search,
round(100.0*sum(invalid_results)/sum(num_search),2)
as invalid_searches_pct
from temp_cte
group by country
order by country;
