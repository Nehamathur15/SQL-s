Question:

UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“
whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.

A long-call is categorised as any call that lasts more than 5 minutes (300 seconds). What's the month-over-month growth of long-calls?

Output the year, month (both in numerical and chronological order) and growth percentage rounded to 1 decimal place.

callers Table:
Column Name	Type
policy_holder_id	integer
case_id	varchar
call_category	varchar
call_received	timestamp
call_duration_secs	integer
original_order	integer

Example Output:
yr	mth	growth_pct
2022	1	
2022	2	-100.0
2022	3	0
2022	4	-50.0
2022	5	33.3

Explanation:
Call counts: Jan - 2 calls; Feb - 1 call; Mar - 1 call; Apr - 2 calls; May - 3 calls

In January, the percentage is 0% as there is no previous month's call info.
In February, there is a 50% drop from 2 calls to 1 call.
In March, no change in percentage.
In April, there are 2 calls, hence a 100% growth from March.
Finally, in May, there were 3 calls thus a 33.3% growth from April.


Solution:

With total_calls AS(
SELECT EXTRACT(year from call_received) as yr,
EXTRACT(month from call_received) as mth,
count(policy_holder_id) as no_of_calls
FROM callers
where call_duration_secs > 300
group by 
EXTRACT(year from call_received),
EXTRACT(month from call_received)
order by 
yr,mth
)
Select yr,mth,
round(100.0*(no_of_calls - lag(no_of_calls,1) over(order by yr,mth))/no_of_calls,1)
as growth_pct
from total_calls
