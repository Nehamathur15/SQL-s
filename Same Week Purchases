Question:

Assume you are given the two tables containing information on Etsyâ€™s user signups and purchases. 
Write a query to obtain the percentage of users who signed up and made a purchase within 7 days of signing up. 
The result should be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.

Assumptions:

Signups who didn't buy any products yet should also count as part of the percentage of users who signed up and made a purchase within 7 days of signing up
If the signup date is on 06/21/2022 and the purchase date on 06/26/2022, then the user makes up part of the percentage of users who signed up and purchased within the 7 days of signing up.

signups Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
signup_date	datetime

user_purchases Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
product_id	integer
purchase_amount	decimal
purchase_date	datetime

Query:
with 
temp_cte1 as(
SELECT count(DISTINCT(signups.user_id)) as purchases_count
FROM signups
inner join user_purchases
on signups.user_id = user_purchases.user_id
where purchase_date <= signup_date + interval '7 day'
),
temp_cte2 as (
Select count(DISTINCT(user_id)) as total_count from signups
)
Select round((100.0*purchases_count/total_count),2) as 
single_purchase_pct 
from temp_cte1, temp_cte2
