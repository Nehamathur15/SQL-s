Question:
Assume you are given the table below containing measurement values obtained from a sensor over several days. Measurements are taken several times within a given day.

Write a query to obtain the sum of the odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements on a particular day, in two different columns.

Note that the 1st, 3rd, 5th measurements within a day are considered odd-numbered measurements and the 2nd, 4th, 6th measurements are even-numbered measurements.

measurements Table:
Column Name	Type
measurement_id	integer
measurement_value	decimal
measurement_time	datetime

Query:
with temp_cte as(
SELECT measurement_value,date(measurement_time) as measurement_day,
RANK() over(
PARTITION BY date(measurement_time)
order by measurement_time) as rank
from measurements
ORDER BY measurement_day)
Select measurement_day,
sum(case when rank%2 != 0.0 then measurement_value else 0 END) as odd_sum,
sum(case when rank%2 = 0.0 then measurement_value else 0 end) as even_sum
from temp_cte
GROUP BY date(measurement_day)
