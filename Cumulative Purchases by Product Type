Assume you are given the table below for the purchasing activity by order date and product type. 
Write a query to calculate the cumulative purchases for each product type over time in chronological order.

Output the order date, product, and the cumulative number of quantities purchased.

total_trans Table:
Column Name	Type
order_id	integer
product_type	string
quantity	integer
order_date	datetime

total_trans Example Input:
order_id	product_type	quantity	order_date
213824	printer	20	06/27/2022 12:00:00
132842	printer	18	06/28/2022 12:00:00

06/27/2022 12:00:00	printer	20
06/28/2022 12:00:00	printer	38


Query (Note- Used window function to calculate sum)
Select order_date,product_type,
sum(quantity) over(PARTITION BY product_type
order by order_date asc rows BETWEEN unbounded preceding and current row)
from total_trans
ORDER BY order_date
