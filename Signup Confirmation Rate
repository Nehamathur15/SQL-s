Question:

New TikTok users sign up with their emails, so each signup requires a text confirmation to activate the new user's account.

Write a query to find the confirmation rate of users who confirmed their signups with text messages. Round the result to 2 decimal places.

Assumptions:

A user may fail to confirm several times with text. Once the signup is confirmed for a user, they will not be able to initiate the signup again.
A user may not initiate the signup confirmation process at all.
emails Table:
Column Name	Type
email_id	integer
user_id	integer
signup_date	datetime

texts Table:
Column Name	Type
text_id	integer
email_id	integer
signup_action	varchar

Query:
with temp_cte as(
SELECT * ,
case when signup_action = 'Confirmed' then 1 else 0 end as confirmed_users,
case when signup_action = 'Not Confirmed' then 1 else 0 end as unconfirmed_users
FROM emails
inner join texts 
on emails.email_id = texts.email_id)
SELECT
ROUND((sum(confirmed_users)*1.0 / (sum(confirmed_users)+sum(unconfirmed_users))),2)
as confirm_rate
from temp_cte
